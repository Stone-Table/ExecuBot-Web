## Who We Are

I'm **Ram Francis**—a Marine turned technologist. My career has taken me from NASA to Facebook to the Department of State, where I’ve seen firsthand how sandbagging and wasted resources, including taxpayer dollars, can cripple missions and slow progress. These experiences inspired me to create Execubot, a tool to cut through the noise and empower teams to succeed.
