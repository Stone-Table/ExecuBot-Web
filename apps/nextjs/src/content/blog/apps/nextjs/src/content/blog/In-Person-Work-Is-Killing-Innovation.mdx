## In-Person Work Is Killing Innovation

In-person work isn’t just inconvenient—it’s actively smothering innovation. The idea that creativity thrives in a cubicle or an open-plan office is a delusion employers cling to for control, not progress. Engineering breakthroughs don’t happen in forced brainstorming sessions or over lukewarm coffee at the watercooler. They come from deep focus, freedom to experiment, and the mental space to solve problems without the constant buzz of office distractions. Yet, companies demand physical presence, as if seeing you at a desk proves you’re innovating. It doesn’t. It’s a leash, not a launchpad.

The real cost is in the talent pool. By tying jobs to specific locations, in-person mandates shrink the world of ideas to those who can live in overpriced tech hubs like San Francisco or Los Angeles. Brilliant engineers in smaller cities, rural areas, or other countries? Out of luck. Their potential stays dormant because they can’t—or won’t—relocate. Innovation suffers when geography trumps talent. Remote work shatters this barrier, letting creativity flow from anywhere, not just where the office lease is signed.

Consider this: a job posting for an software engineer at a climate tech company in LA pops up on LinkedIn. The work could be done from anywhere—climate data doesn’t care where your laptop is—but they insist you move. Why? Not because it’s better for the work, but because it’s easier for them to micromanage. That’s not a recipe for innovation; it’s a chokehold on it. Every hour spent commuting or pretending to look busy is an hour stolen from building something groundbreaking.

## A Future of Remote Work and Impact-Driven Evaluation

Now, picture a different world. Engineers work remotely, free from the fluorescent glare of office lights, and they’re monitored effectively—not with invasive spyware, but with systems that track what actually matters: the impact of their work. No more daily standups to recite what you did yesterday. No more performative “face time” to impress the boss. Instead, your value is measured by the outcomes you deliver—the bugs you fix, the systems you optimize, the features that make users’ lives better.

This isn’t about counting lines of code or tickets closed. That’s quantity, and quantity is a lousy proxy for innovation. Software engineering is an art, not a production line. You wouldn’t judge a sculptor by how many chisel strikes they make in an hour, so why judge an engineer by how much they ship in a sprint? We need a future where evaluation hinges on impact: Did your code make the product faster? Did it solve a real problem? Did it push the boundaries of what’s possible? That’s what drives progress, not performative busywork.

Tools to measure this exist—think code quality analysers, user feedback loops, performance metrics—but we need to stitch them into a cohesive standard. Something beyond DORA metrics, which obsess over speed and frequency but miss the soul of engineering. Impact isn’t just about how fast you deploy; it’s about how much better the world is because of what you built.

## An Engineering Social Credit System

Here’s where it gets bold: we need an engineering social credit system. Imagine a platform where companies opt in to showcase their engineers’ work—not just their commits or pull requests, but the tangible difference their code makes. Did it cut server costs by 30%? Did it boost uptime to five nines? Did it earn a flood of user praise? Engineers would earn rankings based on these contributions, pulling from their work across companies, projects, and even open-source efforts.

This isn’t about reducing engineering to a leaderboard. It’s about stripping away the noise—fancy company logos, leetcode wizardry, networking skills—and letting raw talent shine. Your rank wouldn’t depend on where you work or how well you play the interview game. It’d be a reflection of your impact, period. Companies could use it to spotlight their best engineers, proving they’re not just a brand name but a hub of real innovation. Engineers, meanwhile, get a portable badge of honour that follows them wherever they go.

## The Power of a Merit-Based Rank

There’s real power in this. Imagine an engineer saying, “I rank number one in the country based on my work.” Not because they aced a whiteboard test or landed a gig at a FAANG company, but because their code—across startups, side projects, and open-source repos—consistently delivers. That’s leverage. They can negotiate better pay, pick projects that light them up, or ditch the tech-hub rat race entirely. Their rank isn’t tied to one employer’s opinion; it’s a holistic measure of their craft.

For companies, it’s a wake-up call. Opt in, and you’re forced to prove your engineers are writing great code, not just coasting on reputation. Don’t, and you risk looking like you’ve got something to hide. Either way, the focus shifts from performative metrics—hours logged, PRs merged—to what actually fuels innovation: quality and impact.

## Why This Matters

In-person work is a mental grind—commutes, small talk, the constant pressure to *look* productive. For a job that demands deep thought and creative leaps, it’s a killer. Remote work, paired with impact-based evaluation, frees engineers to create where they thrive, judged by what they achieve, not how they’re seen. Add a social credit system, and you’ve got a recipe for decentralizing talent, breaking the stranglehold of tech hubs, and letting innovation explode from every corner of the globe.

The future isn’t in offices. It’s in a merit-based, remote-first world where engineers are artists, not clock-punchers, and where a number-one rank means you’ve changed the game—not just played it. Let’s stop suffocating innovation and start building that future.
